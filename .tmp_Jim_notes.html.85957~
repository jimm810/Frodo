I modified the contracts_detail index form quite a bit.  I added customer and contract
header information by setting instance variables in the controller and used the form styles
from blueprint.css to add the fieldset tags to the form to improve the look.  
I also used the col-span attributes on the <nav></nav> tags to line data up better.

I also added column totals to the detail lines and removed extraneous data that is now in the headers.

I added a new route so that adding a new row to the contract_details table passes the contract_id
parameter to the controller.  I haven't finished changing the controller and testing the view.

To do: pass a parameter to the create new detail method so that the contract_id is automatically
       associated to a new detail record.  Remove the select box for contract from the form and
	   replace it with a contract# and contract name static value.

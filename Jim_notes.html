I added the drill down functionality to add a row to the contract_detail table while passing
the contract_id value from the contract index view.  The code sample below was helpful.

Sample code found on Stack Overflow that illustrates how to set the parent-child record creation:

I'm assuming you have a journal model that has many articles and an article model that belongs
 to a journal. First, you should create routes to the articles controller that go through journals
  and not through journals:

ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  map.resources :journals, :has_many => :articles
  map.resources :articles
end

Now you can get to the new action of your articles controller with the 
URL /articles/new or /journals/1/articles/new. Then in the new action in your 
articles controller, you do this:

@article = Article.new(:journal_id => params[:journal_id])

Which set the journal_id of the article to whatever parameter is passed in. 
If no parameter is passed, the journal_id will be nil.

In the ERB template, you just do this to create the drop down:

<%= f.collection_select :journal_id, Journal.all(:order => "name"), 
:id, :name, :include_blank => true %>

I modified the contracts_detail index form quite a bit.  I added customer and contract
header information by setting instance variables in the controller and used the form styles
from blueprint.css to add the fieldset tags to the form to improve the look.  
I also used the col-span attributes on the <nav></nav> tags to line data up better.

I also added column totals to the detail lines and removed extraneous data that is now in the headers.

I added a new route so that adding a new row to the contract_details table passes the contract_id
parameter to the controller.  I haven't finished changing the controller and testing the view.

To do: pass a parameter to the create new detail method so that the contract_id is automatically
       associated to a new detail record.  Remove the select box for contract from the form and
	   replace it with a contract# and contract name static value.

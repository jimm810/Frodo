Frodo - this application was written as a prototype "contract execution application".  Andrew Hittle is my co-author on the business rules, logic and process flow of the application.  I did all of the RoR development.

The application has a couple of major objects:

Customers
Contracts
Contract_details

The purpose of this application is to track the service portions of a contract and assign those work items to the appropriate groups for execution.  It provides a view that is connected back to the contract so that a fulfillment manager can ensure that all portions of a contract are being effectively managed and executed.  It also tracks the financial aspects of each service item so that financial metrics and be monitored.
